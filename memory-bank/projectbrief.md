# Project Brief: Claude Talk to Figma MCP

## Project Overview
Claude Talk to Figma MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI tools (Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) to interact directly with Figma through natural language commands. This creates a bridge between AI-powered design assistance and Figma's design environment.

## Core Mission
Enable AI-assisted design workflows by allowing AI tools to:
- Analyze existing Figma designs
- Create and modify design elements programmatically
- Apply design system patterns and best practices
- Automate repetitive design tasks
- Provide intelligent design feedback and suggestions

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Bidirectional Communication**: AI â†” Figma real-time interaction
2. **Comprehensive Tool Set**: Document analysis, element creation, modification, text handling, component management
3. **Multi-Platform Support**: Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, and other MCP-compatible tools
4. **Easy Installation**: One-click DXT package installation for Claude Desktop
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation, testing framework, troubleshooting guides

### Technical Requirements
1. **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full Model Context Protocol implementation
2. **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional messaging
3. **Figma Plugin Integration**: Secure execution environment within Figma
4. **TypeScript Implementation**: Type-safe development with modern tooling
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: macOS, Windows, Linux support

### Quality Requirements
1. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and connection management
2. **Performance**: Efficient command execution and minimal latency
3. **Security**: Safe command execution within Figma's sandbox
4. **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with separated concerns
5. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new tools and capabilities

## Success Criteria
- AI tools can successfully connect to and control Figma
- Users can perform complex design tasks through natural language
- Installation process takes under 5 minutes
- System handles errors gracefully with clear feedback
- Active community adoption and contribution

## Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- MCP server implementation
- Figma plugin for command execution
- WebSocket server for communication
- Comprehensive tool library (40+ tools)
- Documentation and testing framework
- DXT package distribution

**Out of Scope:**
- Direct Figma API integration (uses plugin sandbox)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced AI model training
- Custom Figma plugin UI beyond connection management

## Target Users
1. **Designers**: Using AI to accelerate design workflows
2. **Design Engineers**: Automating design system implementation
3. **Product Teams**: Rapid prototyping and iteration
4. **Developers**: Integrating design tools into development workflows

## Technical Foundation
- **Runtime**: Bun (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Communication**: WebSocket + Figma Plugin API
- **Architecture**: Modular tool-based system
- **Distribution**: NPM package + DXT extension
