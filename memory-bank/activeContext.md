## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Layered Architecture**: Maintaining clear separation between MCP server, WebSocket server, and Figma plugin
2. **Chunked Processing**: Using chunked operations for bulk tasks to prevent UI freezing
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Tools provide intelligent defaults while supporting advanced usage
4. **Error Boundary Pattern**: Each layer handles errors appropriately with context enhancement

### Development Patterns
1. **Tool Organization**: Categorical organization by functional domain (document, creation, modification, text, component)
2. **Promise-Based Communication**: WebSocket communication using promise correlation for async/await compatibility
3. **Progress Streaming**: Real-time progress updates for long-running operations
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with runtime validation via Zod

### User Experience Priorities
1. **Easy Installation**: DXT package for one-click Claude Desktop installation
2. **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and troubleshooting
3. **Performance**: Chunked processing and timeout management
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation and clear error messages

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Preferences
- **Modular Tool Structure**: Each tool category in separate files
- **Consistent Tool Interface**: Uniform parameter validation and error handling
- **Type-First Development**: TypeScript interfaces drive implementation
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults

### Communication Patterns
- **Channel-Based**: Connection establishment via channel IDs
- **Request Correlation**: UUID-based request/response matching
- **Timeout Strategies**: Progressive timeouts (10s connection, 30s standard, 60s complex)
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time feedback for user engagement

### Error Handling Philosophy
- **Layered Validation**: Input validation at MCP layer, API errors at plugin layer
- **Context Enhancement**: Errors enriched with operation context
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Technical errors translated to actionable feedback
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback options when possible

### Performance Considerations
- **Chunked Operations**: Large operations split into manageable chunks (typically 5-10 items)
- **Font Caching**: Loaded fonts cached to avoid repeated loading
- **Connection Reuse**: Single WebSocket connection per session
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and event listeners

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
1. **Figma Plugin Constraints**: Sandbox environment requires careful handling of async operations
2. **WebSocket Reliability**: Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff essential for user experience
3. **MCP Protocol Benefits**: Standardized interface enables multi-tool compatibility
4. **Bun Performance**: Significant performance benefits over Node.js for this use case

### User Experience Insights
1. **Installation Friction**: DXT packages dramatically improved adoption
2. **Progress Feedback**: Users need real-time feedback for bulk operations
3. **Error Context**: Generic errors frustrate users; specific context helps
4. **Documentation Importance**: Clear setup instructions critical for success

### Development Process Insights
1. **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests more valuable than unit tests for this architecture
2. **Version Management**: Automated version synchronization prevents deployment issues
3. **Community Contributions**: Clear contribution guidelines enable external contributions
4. **Platform Differences**: Windows-specific considerations require attention

## Current Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Large Document Performance
**Issue**: Large Figma documents can cause timeout and memory issues
**Current Solution**: Chunked processing with configurable chunk sizes
**Future Consideration**: Adaptive chunk sizing based on document complexity

### Challenge: Font Loading Reliability
**Issue**: Custom fonts may not be available, causing text operations to fail
**Current Solution**: Fallback font strategy with Inter as default
**Future Consideration**: Font availability detection and user notification

### Challenge: Error Context Clarity
**Issue**: Figma API errors can be cryptic for end users
**Current Solution**: Error message enhancement at each layer
**Future Consideration**: Error code mapping to user-friendly explanations

### Challenge: Multi-Platform Compatibility
**Issue**: Different behavior across macOS, Windows, and Linux
**Current Solution**: Platform-specific build scripts and testing
**Future Consideration**: Automated cross-platform testing in CI/CD
