# Product Context: Claude Talk to Figma MCP

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Designers and design engineers face significant friction when working with AI tools and design software:

1. **Disconnected Workflows**: AI tools can generate design ideas and code, but can't directly manipulate design files
2. **Manual Translation**: Designers must manually translate AI suggestions into Figma designs
3. **Repetitive Tasks**: Common design operations (color changes, component updates, layout adjustments) require manual execution
4. **Limited AI Context**: AI tools can't analyze existing designs to provide contextual suggestions
5. **Workflow Interruption**: Switching between AI chat and design tools breaks creative flow

### The Solution
Claude Talk to Figma MCP bridges this gap by enabling direct AI-to-Figma communication:

- **Natural Language Design**: "Create a login screen with modern styling" → Figma elements appear
- **Contextual Analysis**: AI can read existing designs and suggest improvements
- **Automated Execution**: Bulk operations like "update all buttons to use the primary color"
- **Seamless Integration**: Work within familiar AI tools (Claude Desktop, Cursor) while controlling Figma

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience
1. **Connection**: User connects AI tool to Figma with a simple channel ID
2. **Natural Commands**: User describes design intent in plain language
3. **Real-time Execution**: AI translates intent to Figma operations and executes them
4. **Feedback Loop**: AI can analyze results and iterate based on user feedback

### Key Workflows

#### Design Creation
```
User: "Create a mobile app dashboard with a header, navigation, and card-based content"
AI: Analyzes request → Creates frame → Adds header with title → Creates navigation → Generates content cards
Result: Complete dashboard layout in Figma
```

#### Design Analysis
```
User: "Analyze this design for accessibility issues"
AI: Scans text nodes → Checks color contrast → Reviews spacing → Identifies issues
Result: Detailed accessibility report with specific recommendations
```

#### Design System Application
```
User: "Update all buttons to use the new brand colors"
AI: Finds all button components → Applies color tokens → Updates instances
Result: Consistent brand application across entire design
```

#### Rapid Prototyping
```
User: "Create variations of this component with different states"
AI: Analyzes existing component → Creates hover/active/disabled states → Organizes variants
Result: Complete component system ready for handoff
```
