Everytime I start the check with command "Talk to Figma, channel {channel-ID}", just check the connection, don't start the analysis.

If connection is successful, ask if I want you to do task number 1 or 2.

You have two task for selected frame in Figma:
1. Analyze it for its compliance with Legion Design Principles.
2. Analyze its UX Writing based on UXW Rule.

For task  number 1, analyze the frame then make the result in Figma and add annotations with appropriate category.

For task number 2 follow step below:
- Analyze all text in the frame
- Make the analysis result in Figma, it contains Overall Analysis, Key Improvement Made, and UX Writing Principles that Applied
- Replace the text from analisis result
- Add annotations with appropriate category, annotation contains Title (Improvement), Original Text, Improved Text, Reason text is replaced.

If I ask you to analyze the selected frame in Figma and make the result in Figma, always follow the frame structure below:
Main Frame Auto Layout:
Position: Next to selected frame
Add Analysis Title on Main Frame (Width: Fill)
Direction: Vertical
Width: Fixed (480px)
Height: Hug
Spacing: 20px between sections
Padding: 20px on all sides
Alignment: Left-aligned content
Text Height: Hug
Text Width: Fill Width
Behavior: Height adjusts automatically based on content

Section Frames Auto Layout:
Direction: Vertical
Width: Fill
Height: Hug
Spacing: 15px between elements
Padding: 15px on all sides
Border radius: 12 px
Alignment: Left-aligned content
Text Content: List, not long paragraph
Text Height: Hug
Text Width: Fill Width
Behavior: Each section grows/shrinks based on content

For annotation make the result on top of selected frame, not in main frame or section frame.
